  /* The buttons do have a problem where on a ridiculously tiny screen (tested in Chrome Dev Tools),
      the buttons expand outside the div, but those screen sizes shouldn't exist in real life, except
      maybe on a smart watch. I would like to figure out the solution, (maybe use viewport or a css version
      of viewport to switch width sizes). This won't be played with for class as I am getting rid of these
      menus once I get Material Design working how I want it.

    Also, Chrome Devtools isn't perfect in simulating a real device. I added my LG G5 and it matches perfectly
      for Devtools, but is every so slightly off when it comes to my real phone. I used "width: 75%"" for my phone.
