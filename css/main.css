/* Explanation for JET

  Different browsers have different predefined CSS styles to help make a page "legible"
  when the author ultimately doesn't provide them. Many developers don't realize this
  and they don't add every tag necessary to force their page to look the same cross-browser.

  So, I am having to manually reset some CSS values so I can have my page look right when I
  develop my site for Chrome. I will eventually add every CSS tag necessary to work cross-browser.

  For now, I am just developing for Chrome and fixing for Firefox.
